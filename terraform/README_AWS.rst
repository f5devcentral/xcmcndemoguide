Terraform scripts simplify the deployment of a sample app components in multiple cloud environments. In this readme file you can find the links to terraform scripts for all 3 modules run using AWS clouds: 

-	`cloud-a <https://github.com/f5devcentral/xcmcndemoguide/tree/main/terraform/cloud-a/aws>`_ to deploy front-end portal in the AWS Cloud

-	`cloud-b <https://github.com/f5devcentral/xcmcndemoguide/tree/main/terraform/cloud-b/aws>`_ to connect the Refer-a-Friend Widget run in the AWS Cloud

-	`cloud-c <https://github.com/f5devcentral/xcmcndemoguide/tree/main/terraform/cloud-c/aws>`_ to configure the third cloud for connecting the Arcadia Core app (back-end service) to the Transaction Module service

After configuring the AWS cloud for the selected module, go back to the main Demo Guide and follow the further steps.
